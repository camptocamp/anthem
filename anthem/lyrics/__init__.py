"""
Lyrics are isolated pieces of code that you can use and reuse in
your own songs.

They can be structured as you desire, from Haikus to Odes as long as the songs
you write reach the zen of Python and execute harmoniously.

Examples of lyrics are:

 * load a csv, xml or yaml file
 * add a xmlid on a record
 * upsert a record
 * uninstall a module
 * define a setting
